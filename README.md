# Log Parsing and Alert Automation with Python

This project demonstrates how to use Python to automate the parsing of simulated web server logs and detect potential cyberattacks such as SQL Injection, XSS, Directory Traversal, Brute Force Login, and Remote File Inclusion. Alerts are automatically logged when suspicious patterns are found.

It is a hands-on project designed to build foundational skills in log analysis, regex pattern matching, and basic security automation. This project is well-suited for those learning cybersecurity and seeking to build their portfolio.

## How It Works

1. The `parser.py` script reads the `sample.log` file line by line.
2. Using regular expressions (regex), it matches patterns indicative of common attacks.
3. If a match is found, an alert is written to `alerts/alerts.txt` with:
   - Timestamp
   - Type of attack
   - Source IP address
4. For Brute Force Login detection, the script counts failed login attempts per IP, triggering an alert when the threshold (default: 3) is exceeded.

## Sample Attacks Detected

- SQL Injection (`SELECT`, `' OR 1=1`, `--`)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (`<script>`)
- Directory Traversal (`../`)
- Remote File Inclusion (URLs to `.php`, `.txt`, etc.)
- Brute Force Login (`POST /login` + 401)
- Access to Admin Area (`GET /admin/` + 403)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- `re`, `datetime`, `os` (built-in)
- [Optional] `pandas`, `schedule`, `requests` if extending functionality

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)
3. Install dependencies
4. Run the parser script:
```bash
   python3 src/parser.py
```
Output will be saved in:
```bash
alerts/alerts.txt
```
